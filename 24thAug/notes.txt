CSS3
Cascading Style Sheets


Why:
CSS saves time − You can write CSS once and then reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages. You can define a style for each HTML element and apply it to as many Web pages as you want.

Pages load faster − If you are using CSS, you do not need to write HTML tag attributes every time. Just write one CSS rule of a tag and apply it to all the occurrences of that tag. So less code means faster download times.

Easy maintenance − To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.

Superior styles to HTML − CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.

Multiple Device Compatibility − Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones or for printing.

Global web standards − Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.

Css can be written in 3 ways:
Internal css
External css
Inline css

<h1> </h1>

syntax of css:
	selector{
		property:value;
	}

	ex:
		h3{
			color:red;
		}


Different types of selectors:
====================
1) Tag/Element Selector
2) Class Selector
3) Id Selector
4) pseudo selector
5) compound selector

Properties:
-------------
color:red;
text-align:left/center/right;
font-size:16px;/ 1em;
font-family:arial;
background-color:yellow;

comments in css:
----------------------------
// single line comment
/*
multi
line
comment
*/

border:1px solid/dotted/dashed red;
width:300px;
height:300px;

background-image:url(pic.jpg/gif/png);
background-repeat:no-repeat/repeat-x/repeat-y;

Spaces:

margin ==>margin is a outside space of an element
padding ==>padding is inside space of an element

margin:30px;
padding:30px;
text-decoration:none;

============
divisions:
=======
<div> </div> ==>division tag

CLASS SELECTOR:
===============
	class selector starts with dot(.);
	we need to call the class to any element
		.txt{
			color:green;
			}

	<h3 class="txt"> </h3>



17th Aug:
Session 3
========
float:left/right;
clear:left/right/both;
line-height:80px;

ID SELECTOR:
============
	#txt{

		}

	<h3 id="txt"> </h3>

Uniqueness (ID):
An id attribute is designed to uniquely identify a single element within an entire HTML document. Each id value must be unique on a given page.

Reusability (Class):
A class attribute can be applied to multiple HTML elements, allowing for the application of the same styles or behaviors to a group of elements. An element can also have multiple classes assigned to it.

FLEX BOX MODEL:
===============
CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a one-dimensional CSS layout model designed for arranging items in rows or columns. 

It provides an efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items within a container, making it easier to create flexible and responsive designs without relying on floats or positioning.

display:flex;   ==>give this property to parent element
justify-content:flex-start / flex-end /center / space-around /space-between;  =>horizontal alignment
align-items:flex-start / flex-end / center; ==>vertical alignment

RESPONSIVE DESIGNING:
======================
Responsive web design is a web development approach where a website's layout and content adapt to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Media queries:
=============
Media queries are a feature of CSS3 that allow web developers to create responsive web designs. They enable the application of different CSS styles based on various device characteristics, such as screen size, resolution, orientation, and media type. 

@media screen and (max-width:999px){

}
